Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, god, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since god knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, god, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
I miss that town
I miss the faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could I relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me...
Well I wanted you
I wanted no one else
I thought it through
I got you to myself
You got off
Every time you got on to me
I got caught up
In favorable slavery
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?
I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons
Well you know my friends
Well they know your enemies
I'd pretend
Not to hear what they said to me
'Cause I got off
Every time you got on to me
Was it wrong
To go along with insanity?
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?
I guess it wasn't what I wanted
Wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day I got
I want it all to go away
Well you can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
Well you can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
Well you can stick me in a hole
And you can pray all day for rain
You can shoot me in the leg
Just to try to make me beg
And you can leave me there for days 
And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home
And I will survive
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess
You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
You can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home
You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake
And pray I'm never coming back
You can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
You can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
And I will survive
'Cause you're my Mississippi Princess
You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
You can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home
I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'
No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in
You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'
So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in
We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered "what was that?"
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
"That's my dad outside the car!"
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'
So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And all I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And all I scream for you
Come please I'm callin'
And all I need from you
Hurry I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Hurry I'm fallin'
And all I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And all I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Hurry I'm fallin'
Say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
This time, This place
Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know,
you know, you know
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore
On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know,
you know, you know
So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know
I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go
I judge by what she's wearing
Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes coming on to her
Each night seems like it's getting worse
And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
It happens every night she works
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her
Don't they know it's never going to work
They think they'll get inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt
Here comes the next contestant
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant
I even fear the ladies
They're cool but twice as crazy
Just as bad for coming on to her
Don't they know it's never going to work
Each time she bats an eyelash
Somebody's grabbing her ass
Everyone keeps coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt
Here comes the next contestant
I'm hating what she's wearing
Everybody here keeps staring
Can't wait 'til they get what they deserve
This time somebody's getting hurt
Here comes the next contestant
I wish you'd do it again
Each night seems like it's getting worse
I wish you'd do it again
This time somebody's getting hurt
There goes the next contestant
Uncle Sam taught him to shoot
Maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage
And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard him say
Oh God, don't let him pull it
Please God, don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it
How could you take his life away?
What made you think u had the right?
How could you be so full of hate?
To take away somebody's life
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home and on my own,
I cried alone
And scratched your name
On the side of a bullet
And in the wake of his mistake
So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use
Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say
God why'd you let him do it?
How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it
How could you take his life away?
What made you think u had the right?
How could you be so full of hate?
To take away somebody's life
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world
all wonder why
I sat at home and cried alone
and on my own
I scratched your name
On the side of a bullet
From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing
Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive
(I'm alive)
And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died...
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day when nobody died
I reside in 209, you're in 208
You moved in last Friday night, 
and I just couldn't wait
So I tried to call across the hall, 
to ask you out someday
But a lineup formed outside your door, and I was way too late
Well I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like 
some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want
I'm sitting here in second place
Because somewhere 
the one I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with 
I wanna be that someone 
that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
Well I hear your favorite songs 
you sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that 
I don't need for conversation sake
Last night I heard your key, 
it hit your lock at 4 AM
Instead of being out with me 
you must be out with them
Because somewhere the one 
I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I wanna be that 
someone that you're with 
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
Well somewhere the one 
I wanna be with's 
with somebody else
Oh god, I wanna be that 
someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long 
'til I run out of breath
But I still wanna be that 
someone that you're with
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him 
somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I've got to be that 
someone that
I wanna be that someone that
I've got to be that 
someone that you're with
I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
Tell me what you want
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
So what you need?
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
Been there, done that
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
So how you gonna do it?
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair, and well
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
So how you gonna do it?
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Climb into the ring for a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing, it will still mean nothing
Should’ve seen it coming
It had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife
To an all out gun fight
And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
get up, get up
Who do you think you are
get up so we can finish this
Is this what you came for
get up, get up
Well this means war
get up so we can finish this
Say anything you want
But talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you've brought was psychological warfare
Well there’s no getting out
And now you got to wonder
Who will dig you out when you’re six feet under
And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
get up, get up
Who do you think you are
get up so we can finish this
Is this what you came for
get up, get up
Well this means war
get up so we can finish this
And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave
You’ve gone too far
get up, get up
Who do you think you are
get up so we can finish this
Is this what you came for
get up, get up
Well this means war
get up so we can finish this
Well this means war
Who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit til it's dry.
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need.
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up , hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.
(Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
Ohhh, bottoms up
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar.
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire.
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline.
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.
(Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
Ohhh, bottoms up.
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out.
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.
Bottoms up
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
Hey! Bottoms up.
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
Just like a heart beat
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win
I'm in a bar full of bikers and a handful of junkies
It's a 50-50 chance that they're planin' to jump me,
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive!
Oh! Well my favorite little waitress has a hold on my eye,
But there's a shotgun loaded hidden under the bar,
Her finger's on the trigger, if anybody gets outta line!
There's other places that are better to go,
But I'm addicted to the red light show,
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole,
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
Well she walks like a model and she talks like a trucker,
Doesn't want a lollipop but she sure loves a sucker.
They're closin' in around her, I'm cuttin' to the front of the line!
She's got a bottle of Tequila and a lime for her lips
Lay that body on the bar and put that salt on her hips,
I was lyin' when I told her that I'm only gonna lick her tonight!
There's other places that are better to go,
But I'm addicted to the red light show,
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole,
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
She's gonna be, my, sex machine,
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
She's gonna be, my, midnight queen,
Lock 'n' load and I'm ready to go!
She's gonna lick, my, pistol clean,
She's got a hold on me and ain't lettin' go!
She's gonna be, my, sex machine,
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of the things that she does!
I went out on the town with a friend last weekend
His ex-girlfriend's friend was there alone
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling,
She could really handle alcohol
Another one down and headed off the deep end
The more we drank, the less that we had on
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Lookin' like a rockstar, she'll be the talk of the town
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God almighty! Look at that body
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun
Well, she can get lower than a Maserati
Never seen somebody move that way
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party
Everybody wants to know her name
And it turns out she's got everything I want, all rolled into one
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Lookin' like a rockstar, and she likes to go out and
Get her hands on
Anything to stand on
Anything to dance on
And she'd be swingin' around
Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight
Even goin' all night
She'll be the talk of the town, you know
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
God almighty! Look at that body
Flickers like a sticker on a new Ferrari
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun
Hotter than a barrel on a squeezed machine gun
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar
Lookin' like a rockstar, and she likes to go out and
Get her hands on
Anything to stand on
Anything to dance on
And she'd be swingin' around
Under the hot lights, underneath the spotlight
Even goin' all night
She'll be the talk of the town, you know
She's got everything I want, but all rolled into one
Gotta get me some
I gotta get me some
Gotta get me some
Well, I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Well, everybody's hit the bottom
Everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah, everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hanging on...
Just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,
Kiss it goodbye, goodbye,
Hollywood is plastic
But easy on the eyes
Big Apple is fantastic
But cuts you down to size
They'll treat you like a doormat
Expecting you to fail
Says right across your forehead
Integrity for sale
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
(Kiss it goodbye)
Stealing comes with practice
Lying comes with ease
But neither one is faster
Than falling to your knees
Money leads to fame
And fame is the disease
The latest epidemic
Reality TV
You'll be on TV
When it starts to snow in hell
(Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it)
You won't believe me
So go and see it for yourself
That brunettes move to New York
Blondes love California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
And kiss it goodbye
Teach you that you better flaunt it
Make you wish you never got it
So let's move to New York
Or out to California
East coast digs the cocaine
West coast marijuana
Don't be surprised
When you swallow more than pride
It's tough to see through bullshit
When it's up above your eyes
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
They...won't...let...you get out alive
Your ass...Grab it...And kiss it goodbye
You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
And trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go (That's why it's harder to let you go)
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, whispered right in my ear
Said, I've been dying to tell you
That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, from what we're fighting for
We just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on and hold on
I keep listening to my chest
For a beat but there’s nothing left
It’s been a week since I’ve seen you
And I still can’t believe it
'Cause I’m dying inside alone
And every day we gotta be apart
I’m like a baby with a broken heart
But the second that I'll see you
You will know how much I need you
Because I’ll never be letting you go
Well you know I...
I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on, hold on
And if I could write a symphony
Then baby you would be my melody
And you would flow like a river
Slowly going on forever
Like a feather that’s blowing away
Like everyone that needs a fairytale
Like every mother’s love that never fails
Like every game that needs a player
Every sinner needs a savior
I'm the villain you're willing to save
Now you know why
I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
And I’m willing to wait
Just to see you another day
What I’m waiting for
Will wash this pain away
And it’s never too late
Never too late...
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
I’ll hold on and hold on
Now you know why
I’m lost without you
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one I can’t go without
If I ain't holding on to you then I'll be holding out forever
I’ve got you now and
I’m not letting go of you
Never be together long enough
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
And if forever never comes then I
'Cause every moment I’m with you
It’s like I’m holding on to heaven
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
Well, I've got two tickets to the game
It'd be great if I could take you to it this Sunday
And I'll walk you home when the whole thing's done
If you're there, I don't even care which team won
We can stop at the coffee shop
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot
We can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, Don't ever let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
Saturday, I'm gonna take her out
Cause her favorite band is gonna play downtown
Gonna sing the song we've all heard of
About those two young friends that should've fell in love
Later on, we'll cut through the park
And she can hold my hand, cause she hates the dark
And we can laugh as we both pretend
That we're not in love and that we're just good friends
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And I know you feel the same way
Cause you told me drunk on your birthday
And as you pulled to me
You whispered in my ear, Don't ever let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end 
Please promise me that this won't end
Don't ever let it end
The greatest times we ever had
It's crazy now just looking back, we can laugh
You never know where life's gonna go
Cause we're the only ones who'll ever know
About Sunday night just her and I
Sitting side by side in the full moonlight
I pulled her close, just to hold her tight
And the both of us could tell it just felt right
She looked at me in the sweetest way
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say
Must've took a while just to find the words
Cause she cut me off and finally said it first
Well, I'm tired of pretending
But I'm terrified of it ending
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end
And you know I feel the same way
Cause I told you drunk on my birthday
And as you pulled me near
You whispered in my ear, Don't ever let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Please promise me that this won't end
Don't ever let it end
Don't let it end
Don't let it end
Don't ever let it end
